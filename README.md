## Translation Assistance
This translation was assisted by GPT-4, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. GPT-4 provided valuable initial translations and suggestions, but the final text has been thoroughly proofread and edited by me to ensure accuracy and coherence. I am extremely grateful that I can access such advanced technology.

## Transcription Process
I have personally transcribed the scanned images of the original book, written in French, into text. Prior attempts to use text recognition software resulted in significant errors during the conversion from image to text.

## Editorial Philosophy
I have taken care to make minimal changes to the text to preserve the authenticity of the document. Minor revisions were undertaken to correct unnatural phrasing and to clarify mathematical terms and equations. Any changes made are indicated in the LaTeX code of this document.

### On the Term "Living Force"
The term "living force" was not translated into its modern equivalent, "kinetic energy." I am quite fond of this historical phrase and preferred to keep it intact. I think "living force" is a much too beautiful phrase to remove from this book.

## Accuracy of Equations
Considerable effort has been put into ensuring the accuracy of the equations in this book. Despite these efforts, there may still be errors in the translation. If any are discovered, or if there are suggestions for improvements, please feel free to email me. I welcome and appreciate any feedback.
